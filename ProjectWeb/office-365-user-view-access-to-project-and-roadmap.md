# Office 365 user view access to Project and Roadmap

An appropriate Project Plan license needs to be assigned to your Office 365 users to use [Project for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108301) or [Roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Welcome-to-Roadmap-57764149-51b8-468f-a50d-9ea6a4fd835a). However, users that are assigned certain Office 365 licenses are allowed to have view access to Project for the web and Roadmap. 
This will allow them to have read-only access to projects and roadmaps that are shared with them, without needing to be assigned a Project Plan license.

 If your users need to be able to edit or create projects or roadmaps, you will need to purchase the appropriate Project Plan license and assign it to the user.



> [!Note] 
> For more information about Project Plan subscriptions, see the [Project service description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description)
