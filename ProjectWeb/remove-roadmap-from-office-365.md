# Remove Project for the web or Roadmap from Office 365

You can turn Project for the web or Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This will prevent your users from using them, but will not remove any user data that currently exists. (Note that it may take a few minutes for functionality to be disabled while the setting synchronizes across your tenant.)

To turn off Project for the web:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Settings**, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Project**.
3. Uncheck **Turn Project for the web on for your entire organization**.
4. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Although this setting currently displays in your Project settings, it will not be enabled until a later date (see your Message Center). You can still [turn off Project for the web for individual users](turn-project-for-the-web-off.md). 

To turn off Roadmap:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Settings**, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Project**.
3. Uncheck **Turn Roadmap on or off for your entire organization**.
4. Click **Save**.

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Project for the web and Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted when your Project Online subscription ends.
